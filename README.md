# Directive-Based-VV-Generator
The Directive Based Validation & Verification Results Generator is a one stop shop for producing results for test suite runs. 

The results generator takes in JSON files to create graphs, compare passing and failing tests for different compiler versions, generate organized charts that can be downloaded as an excel sheet, produce compiler & runtime failures with reasoning, and allow for single and double JSON file inputs.
